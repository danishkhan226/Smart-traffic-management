Software Requirements

Python:

Version: 3.13.5 (your current version).
Installation: Ensure it’s installed (check with python --version).
Reason: Core language for the project.


Virtual Environment:

Tool: venv (built into Python).
Setup: Already created as traffic_env at C:\Users\danis\Downloads\project\traffic_env.
Activation: traffic_env\Scripts\activate (Windows).
Reason: Isolates project dependencies.


Dependencies (Python Libraries):

Install via pip within the virtual environment:
bashpip install ultralytics fastapi uvicorn python-multipart opencv-python numpy

Details:

ultralytics: For YOLOv8 (version 8.2.0+ recommended).
fastapi: For the API framework.
uvicorn: ASGI server to run FastAPI.
python-multipart: Enables file uploads in FastAPI.
opencv-python: For video/image processing (cv2).
numpy: For array operations.


Optional (for GPU support):

torch and torchvision with CUDA: pip install torch==2.5.0 torchvision==0.20.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 (adjust CUDA version to your GPU).




Frontend (if used):

File: frontend.py (assumed to use Dash).
Dependencies: pip install dash.
Reason: Displays upload interface and results.


Model File:

File: yolov8n.pt (pre-trained YOLOv8 nano model, ~6MB).
Source: Download from Ultralytics releases.
Location: C:\Users\danis\Downloads\project\yolov8n.pt.
Reason: Core detection model.
